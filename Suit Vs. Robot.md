# The debate
It stems from the initial idea for this project, Joe wanted to be able to walk around in the power armor for Halloween, but I thought it would be cooler, funnier, better, and more educational if we do a robot. We had a little bit of a discussion and eventually decided on going for the robot idea. We each presented our ideas to Griffin and he decided on robot. That's how the project got its name, actually. T-60PAR or T-60 Power Armor Robot.
