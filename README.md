# T-60PAR
The T-60 Power Armor is a power armor set from Fallout 4. We want to turn that set into a reality, but instead of a human pilot, it's a raspberry pi. The T-60PAR will be life sized "replica" of the T-60 power armor that can walk around and do basic tasks (like not falling and getting up after it falls).
