## The Idea
Ok so basically we want to build a life-size replica of the [T-60 Power Armor](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/T-60_power_armor_(Fallout_4)) From [Fallout 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4) and roboticize it.

## The execution
* 3d printed shell
* Aluminum extrusion endoskeleton
* Raspberry pi/Arduino controller
* Nema stepper motors for fine control and power

## The plan
The [printers](Printer%20Farm.md) are currently not set up, and they need to be so that we can start the prototyping faze. Eventually the entire shell will be 3d printed (perhaps except for the feet) and that requires a LOT of printing time. Thankfully, between the 3 of us we have at least 9 printers that (with a little TLC) can be up and running probably non-stop. With that going, we need the frame. The frame will likely be made up of [aluminum extrusions](hhtps://8020.net) and we will have to cut them to size. Given the nature of 8020 aluminum extrusions, the endoskeleton will be very boxy. to compensate, it will need to be small to ensure the proper sizing of the outer shell components. Hopefully, we can strike a balance between size and capacity, as we need space to put components. We will need 1 person on printing duty and the other 2 to be figuring out how to make the frame. Once the frame is built, we will add on motors and the joints to see it moving and ensure everything works before we put on the finished shell pieces (after they have all been cleaned up and painted). Then starts the monstrous task of coding. I will not go into detail on that, as I myself have no idea how it will be achieved.

## Assignments
### Joe
Working on the 3d models and the printers. He will manage the printers and learn how to use them, how to clean up parts, how to paint, join, refinish, etc. This gives him skills like painting and texturing but also 3d modeling. In addition it will allow him to learn how to use a 3d printer which will be useful as he now has one.
### Griffin
Working on the frame and coding. He will be assisting me in assembling the endoskeleton and will be coding the final project. This gives him skills like building things from scratch and coding. This gives him creativity.
### Max
I will be working on assembling the frame with griffin and the electronics. I will assemble the motors, wiring, etc. to ensure it is all working. In addition, I will be mostly "managing" (for lack of a better term) the project (it's a group effort but I will take notes and assist other people when necessary).
